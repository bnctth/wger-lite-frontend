# wger Lite Frontend

This project provides an aesthetically pleasing, but in functionality limited fronted for [wger](https://wger.de), an
open source fitness management server.

This project was made as homework for Client Side Systems, a course of Budapest University of Technology and Economics,
where our goal was to learn about React and Blazor without any prerequisite knowledge other than basic web
technologies (HTML + CSS + JS).
